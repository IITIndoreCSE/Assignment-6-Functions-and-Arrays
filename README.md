# Lab 6: Functions and Arrays - A Simple Guide

**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Lab 6. This lab helps you learn about **functions** and how to work with **arrays**.


## Objective
Practice arrays, functions, and how they can be used together.

## What to implement
1. `calculator.cpp`
    - This program is a simple calculator you must write with functions. Just so you know â€“ the function prototypes have already been declared for your convenience.
2. `array_functions.cpp`
   - In this program, you have to use functions for performing operations on an array, namely:
     - Displaying(printing) the array
     - Finding the sum of all array elements
     - Finding the average of all array elements
     - Finding the maximum element in the array
     - Finding the minimum element in the array
   - Sample input
     `7`
     `12 45 67 23 89 34 56`
   - Sample output
    Array: {12, 45, 67, 23, 89, 34, 56}

    Array size: 7 elements
   
    Sum of elements: 326
    Average of elements: 46.57
    Maximum element: 89
    Minimum element: 12
4. `reverse_array.cpp`
   - In this program, you have to reverse the array
   - But, there is a catch. You cannot create another array or any data structure.

## What do you need to do?
1. Download this repository as a .zip.
2. Extract all folders and remember the location.
3. After extracting, you might rename the folder to something simple that is easy to type in the terminal.
4. Edit the code files only wherever necessary in the system, and **DO NOT CHANGE THE TEMPLATE** otherwise.

## Handy Commands
1. To run checks
   - `chmod +x check.sh`
   - `./check.sh`
2. To compile locally
   - `g++ filename.cpp -o executable_file_name`
   - `./executable_file_name`
## Do you need any help?

If your code isn't working:
1. Be sure that you have not changed the template.
2. Look for any mismatch in spaces and lines.
3. Check if you have semicolons at the end of lines.
4. Make sure your braces { } match up.
5. Make sure that you handle boundary cases properly.


Good luck, Happy Coding :)
